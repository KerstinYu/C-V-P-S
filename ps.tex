%Understanding of the world is mainly a process of answering a series of `\emph{How}' questions, rather than hunting for the `\emph{Why}'s in the jungle. Deeply enchanted by the desire for knowledge, I devoted myself to learning the marvels of the world, acquiring ways to describe this knowledge and applying them back into life for a better well-being.

As an Uyghur, I was raised in Urumqi (Xinjiang, a province of Western China), an extremely conservative area with a different language and religion from the rest of China. As such, literature, especially scientific literature, is scarce and less documented in our native language. To get a better education, I decided to go to Changchun as a teenager to start my high school education.  Moving from Western China to East China, I quickly adapted myself to the new life style and learned proficient Mandarin. I gradually stood out among both local and ethnic minority students due to my academic performance. In 2010, I was the first student ever from Changchun Hope High School (with a history of over 60 years) to be accepted to Peking University, China's top university. 

%\setlength{\parfillskip}{0pt plus 1fil}
\setlength{\parindent}{15pt} % Default is 15pt.

The competitive learning environment in Peking University imposed more challenges than those in high school. In addition to learning the lessons for my major, I had to start to learn another foreign language, English, to equip myself to learn from influential papers in scientific journals. However, over time I adjusted both socially and academically, which is evidenced by the year-to-year GPA improvement (and increase in friends).

As for my research, I like to take a strict mathematical approach to solve scientific questions in a quantitative and measurable way. 

Early in my sophomore, I joined the Motor Control Lab where I learned psychological experiment designs and programming in MATLAB. I was first inspired by a paper on the role of auditory signals in resolving complex biological motion perception, and asked myself whether another sensory modality, such as tactile inputs could also have a similar effect. I contacted Dr. Lihan Chen from Multisensory Lab for help in designing and implementing the study. In his lab, I learned how to operate the tactile device from scratch. It was an arduous process to figure out the exact parameters such as various optical diopter  glasses, stereoscope positions, and the configurations of visual stimuli. In the end, I found the optimized parameters to simulate visual and tactile stimuli to measure the cross-modal effect. I spent around 800 research hours carrying out the experimental study with mostly self-taught MATLAB and data analysis. During this project, I learned how to scientifically pinpoint a specific problem and enjoyed solving the potential intriguing puzzles in this manner. This project was later expanded and won the Beijing Innovation Fund for Undergraduate Students to support the subsequent research. These innovative explorations were promising and were presented consecutively in Vision Science Society's Annual Conference in Naples, Florida 2013, and Asian Pacific Conference of Vision in Suzhou, China 2013.

My next step was to consolidate my findings with more paradigms and reveal the underlying cognitive mechanism in tactile-visual cross-modal interaction. Therefore, for my undergraduate thesis, I asked whether an individual's cognitive states could influence this modulation of tactile input to visual perception. I measured social anxiety and interpersonal reactivity including empathic concern and found that higher interpersonal reactivity influenced the directional perception of walkers more readily when a positive face valence background (happy face) was presented. Subjects with higher social anxiety also demonstrated a stronger facing bias. My thesis was highly appreciated by the evaluation committee and obtained the highest grade (A+). Now as a research assistant, I am starting to explore the neural mechanism with functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI).

%During three years of research on cross-modal perception and also driven by great interest in Computer Science, I have developed an open-source library for biological motion research of over 8500 lines of MATLAB code. I was captivated by GNU/Linux and learned many programming languages and computation techniques such as pattern recognition and optimal control, and read a wide range of literature from G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorem to Turing's theory of universal computation to Minsky's Emotion Machine. I began to understand the exquisite complexity and sophistication of human intelligence and why a complete understanding of the human mind is one of the greatest intellectual challenges in the current age. To build and foster my computing skills, I attended many relevant courses including a collaborative advanced summer school seminar between Tsinghua University and New York University for graduate students on Bayesian Modeling of Perception. I also worked in the Motor Control lab in our department, implementing a virtual reality environment with Python, where an observer could wear a headset and use a joystick to target certain flying objects in the sky. This program was used to reduce reaction-time and operation delay in relevant tasks.

%My interest in social cognitive styles and computation urged me to look for an answer to this question: \textit{Whether and to what extent can computers recognize and emulate human emotions?} Intelligence is one important dimension in human's cognitive abilities while other dimensions such as emotions and creative-thinking also play an important role. However, intelligence has been the main concern in the majority of AI community, while emotions and creative thinking have largely been overlooked. After reading Picard's (1995) Affective Computing and some of her recent papers, I found a sense of passion and direction for my future scientific career. In order to pursue and develop this passion, I want to find a way to combine my cognitive psychology background with a deepened understanding of CS theories and AI techniques. I would like to address this question with a comprehensive approach, including probability-based computational modeling, facial-expression recognition, real-time visual facial expressions rendering, and wearable devices. I am prepared to learn any interesting new approaches and topics in this regard and would love for the opportunity to take on new challenges.

What exactly is going on while people are performing these complex tasks is an intriguing topic, and combining behavioral experiments and computational modeling could provide a clearer understanding. I would like to address this question with a comprehensive approach, including probability-based computational modeling, behavioral experiments and pattern recognition. I am prepared to learn any interesting new approaches and topics in these regards and would love for the opportunity to take on new challenges. I was excited to learn about Prof. Bob McMurray, Prof. Andrew Hollingworth and Prof. D. Windschitl on their research interests and ongoing research from some of their recent papers, and tried making initial contact with the potential PIs and some lab members. I would love to join any of their labs if I am admitted. I am quite interested in Prof. McMurray's approach with computational modeling on speech recognition; Prof. Hollingworth's research with scene perception and object recognition and Prof. Windschitl's apprach to decision making with probabilistic models. I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with them. Therefore, I believe Department of Psychology in University of Iowa could provide the best academic and social environment for my graduate study.

%My interest in social cognitive styles and computation urged me to look for an answer to this question: \textit{Whether and to what extent can computers recognize and emulate human emotions?} Intelligence is one important dimension in human's cognitive abilities while other dimensions such as emotions and creative thinking also play an important role. However, intelligence has been the main concern in the majority of AI community, while emotions have largely been overlooked. After finding out about Bayesian modeling and reading some of the latest papers on the application of the theory, I found a sense of passion and direction for my future scientific career. In order to pursue and develop this passion, I want to find a way to combine my cognitive psychology background with a deepened understanding of CS theories and AI techniques. For my graduate research, I would like to try to explore computational cognitive models on processes involving facial expression recognition/emulation, action recognition etc. What exactly is going on while people performing these complex tasks is an intriguing topic, and combining neuroimaging techniques (fMRI) and computational modeling could provide a clearer understanding. I am also interested in strategic games (I even wrote an emulator for the board game \textit{The Resistance} and a bot to play the game last year), since this is also an interesting way to study how people solve problems and come up with novel ideas. I would like to address this question with a comprehensive approach, including probability-based computational modeling, fMRI, machine-learning, pattern recognition and face processing. I am prepared to learn any interesting new approaches and topics in this regard and would love for the opportunity to take on new challenges. I see myself as a university professor doing research to try and extend our understanding to answer that question.

Her approach to biological motions and social cognition with fMRI, EET and TMS could provide me with much deeper understanding in the neural basis for these higher-order cognitive skills. In the same aspect, I would love the opportunity to join Vision Lab directed by Dr. Jason M. Gold and keep on doing research on biological motions and facial expression recognition. Since I am also interested in decision making, I found the projects about statistical learning, visual feature extraction and decision making in Memory and Perception Lab directed by Rechard Shiffrin quite impressive as well as Dr. Robert M. Nosofsky's research involving relations between categorization and decision making. There are so many attractive research going on in IU Bloomington and I really cannot wait to dedicate myself to any of them.
